# interview-questions
This repository is a collection of my solutions to various leetcode problems.
You should be able to find the link to the actual problem at the top of each script.
Many of these come from popular lists of challenges that people try to use as interview prep.
I started with the [Leetcode 75](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/?progress=sjv3mjj)
and have recently swapped over from that to [neetcode's practice 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) and plan to eventually get around to the blind 75.
